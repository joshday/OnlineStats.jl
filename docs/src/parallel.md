# Parallel Computation

Two `OnlineStat`s can be merged together, which facilitates [Embarassingly parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel) computations.  Merging in **OnlineStats** is used by [**JuliaDB**](https://github.com/JuliaComputing/JuliaDB.jl) to run analytics in parallel on large persistent datasets.

!!! note
    In general, `fit!` is a cheaper operation than `merge!`.

## ExactStat merges

Many `OnlineStat`s are capable of calculating the exact value as a corresponding offline estimator.  For these types, the order of `fit!`-ting and `merge!`-ing does not matter.

```julia
y1 = randn(10_000)
y2 = randn(10_000)
y3 = randn(10_000)

s1 = Series(Mean(), Variance(), Hist(50))
s2 = Series(Mean(), Variance(), Hist(50))
s3 = Series(Mean(), Variance(), Hist(50))

fit!(s1, y1)
fit!(s2, y2)
fit!(s3, y3)

merge!(s1, s2)  # merge information from s2 into s1
merge!(s1, s3)  # merge information from s3 into s1
```

## Other Merges

For `OnlineStat`s that rely on approximations, merging isn't always a well-defined operation.  OnlineStats will either make a sane choice for merging or print a warning that merging did not occur.  Please open an [issue](https://github.com/joshday/OnlineStats.jl/issues) to discuss a stat you believe you should be merge-able.
