# Weight

Many `OnlineStat`s are parameterized by a `Weight` that controls the influence of new observations.  If the `OnlineStat` is capable of calculating the same result as a corresponding offline estimator, it will have a keyword argument `weight`.  If the `OnlineStat` uses stochastic approximation, it will have a keyword argument `rate`.  

Consider how weights affect the influence of the next observation on an online mean ``\theta^{(t)}``, as many `OnlineStat`s use updates of this form.  A larger weight  ``\gamma_t`` puts higher influence on the new observation ``x_t``:

```math
\theta^{(t)} = (1-\gamma_t)\theta^{(t-1)} + \gamma_t x_t
```

!!! note 
    The values produced by a `Weight` must follow two rules:
    1. ``\gamma_1 = 1`` (guarantees ``\theta^{(1)} = x_1``)
    1. ``\gamma_t \in (0, 1), \quad \forall t > 1`` (guarantees ``\theta^{(t)}`` stays inside a convex space)

## Custom Weighting

The `Weight` can be any callable object that receives the number of observations as its argument.  For example:

- `weight = inv` will have the same result as `weight = EqualWeight()`.
- `weight = x -> .01` will have the same result as `weight = ExponentialWeight(.01)`

```@repl 
using OnlineStats # hide

y = randn(100);

fit!(Mean(weight = EqualWeight()))
fit!(Mean(weight = inv))

fit!(Mean(weight = ExponentialWeight(.01)))
fit!(Mean(weight = x -> .01))
```
